- Smart Follow‑up: Conversion Rate × **1.20** (multi‑touch sequences)
- Lead Qualification: Revenue × **1.10** (better targeting + cross‑sell)
- Smart Scheduling: Staff Admin Hours × **0.70** (≈30% efficiency gain)
- Reach Rate: **≈95% automated**, **≈5% manual**
- Speed‑to‑Contact: **~2 minutes** (target; <5 minutes = 21× qualification lift)
